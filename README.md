# Dojour Event Feed Plugin
A simple jQuery plugin for adding a [Dojour](https://dojour.us) event feed to your website.

## Installation
### Step 1 - Include jQuery
You may already have this included, but if add this to the <head> of your html:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src='https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js'></script>
```

Or find the most up-to-date version [here](https://code.jquery.com/jquery/)

### Step 2 - Include Dojour Javascript and CSS files
Also add this to the <head> of your html underneath the jQuery snippet.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src='https://dojour.us/assets/js/dojour.min.js'></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://dojour.us/assets/css/dojour-plugin.css">
```

DO NOT download this file. Keep the source url pointing to dojour.us. This will make sure we can make changes for you as our api evolves.

### Step 3 - Customizing the plugin
Create a div with the id ‘dojour-feed’ and add the following line to a javascript file or in a script tag.
At minimum, provide the username for dojour event feed you want to display.

```html
<div id='dojour-feed'></div>
<script>
	$('#dojour-feed').dojour({
		username:'yourUserName'
	});
</script>
```

This will call the Dojour API and return any upcoming events you’ve added, starred, or reposted.

Here’s a simple example of all these step together:
```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script type="text/javascript" src='https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js'></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src='https://dojour.us/assets/js/dojour.min.js'></script>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://dojour.us/assets/css/dojour-plugin.css">
	</head>
	<body>

		<div id='dojour-feed'></div>

		<script>
			$('#dojour-feed').dojour({
				username:'yourusername'
			});
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

The <body> will be converted into something like this:

```html
<div id='dojour-feed'>
	<div class='dojour-event-list'>
		...template with Event 1...
		...template with Event 2…
		...template with Event 3…
		...template with Event 4...
	</div>
	<button id="dojour-more">More</button>
</div>
```

## Customization

### Templating
You can override the plugin's default template by creating your own like so:

```html
<script id="event-list-template" type="text/template">
	<div>
		<h1>
			<a href="{{event_url}}">{{title}}</a>
		</h1>
		<h2>{{day_abrv}} {{date}} {{month_abrv}}: {{duration}}</h2>
		<img src="{{photo}}" />
		<p>{{description}}<p>
	</div>
</script>

<div id='dojour-feed'></div>

<script>
      jQuery('#dojour-feed').dojour({
          username:'your_username',
          template: jQuery('#event-list-template').html()
      });
</script>
```
